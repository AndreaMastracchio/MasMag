# Magento Module
Module that hooks into two events "controller_action_predispatch_checkout_cart_index" and "controller_action_predispatch_checkout_index" to add a free product.

in the admins configuration there are two cases for two groups in which to hook a product via sku. At this point the product is added to the cart and a message is added for the user.

Complement the minimal logic to the cart.
